"""
EagleEye Autonomous Scanner — The deal-finding machine.

This is NOT a simple search tool. EagleEye continuously scans multiple
data sources, cross-references signals, and outputs qualified deal
opportunities across ALL capital types (bonds, bridge, perm, equity, C&I).

Signal Sources:
1. EDGAR — Form D (private placements), 8-K (material events), S-1
2. FRED — rate environment signals (when rates drop, refi wave starts)
3. ATTOM — property data, ownership changes, permit activity
4. CoStar — occupancy, rent trends, construction pipeline
5. EMMA — municipal bond issuances, continuing disclosures
6. Web/News — industry publications, press releases, deal announcements
7. Public Records — construction permits, certificates of occupancy, UCC filings
8. LinkedIn — executive movements, company updates
9. CMBS Data — loan maturities, delinquencies, special servicing

Signal Types:
- CONSTRUCTION_EXIT: New build complete, below stabilization, needs bridge or perm
- BRIDGE_MATURING: Bridge loan approaching maturity, needs perm takeout
- STABILIZED_REFI: Property hit 90%+ occupancy, ready for perm/bond
- EXPANSION: Existing operator expanding, needs construction financing
- ACQUISITION: M&A activity, needs acquisition financing
- DISTRESSED: Loan modification, special servicing, workout
- RATE_SIGNAL: Rate environment creates refi opportunity (NPV savings)
- PERMIT_SIGNAL: Construction permit filed, new development starting
- OWNERSHIP_CHANGE: Property sold, new owner may need financing
- MATURITY_WALL: Loan maturing in 6-18 months, borrower needs solution

Each signal gets scored, qualified, and routed to the right capital solution.
